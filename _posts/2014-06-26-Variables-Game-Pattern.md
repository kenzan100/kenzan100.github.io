#"Variables" Game Pattern

##Brief Summary
* Every game has its __variables__, in another word, some values which __changes__ as game goes on.
* Most of times, you get to control the variables, how you __allocate__ them to convert to other valuable elements of the game.
* What's important is, there always is some __irregularity__ when converting variables to other game elements. If the conversion always results the same way, there's no fun controlling the variables as a player.

###Game Example
* Almost any game should have a number of variables.
* Most obvious examples are tactics games. You get some __victory points__(or whatever the points you get when game goes) as you play, and you allocate them to grow your units.
* Stronger units requires more variables to convert, weaker ones less. However, which unit is better __depends__ on each game situation.
* Therefore, some variable conversion is thought to be __better__ than others, and that's what makes players keep excited.
* This screen shot should explain this game pattern. ![game variable allocation](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_B7puBFSDK1I/TPH4dHp_udI/AAAAAAAAABQ/vskTcHyyX8U/s1600/Company-of-heroes-online-store.jpg)
