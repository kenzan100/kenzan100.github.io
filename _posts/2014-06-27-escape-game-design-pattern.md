##Game Dynamics Analysis
* The game is following typicall ["Stress and Catharsis"](#) pattern.
* When you first look at the game screen, there should be nothing special about it.
* You keep clcking every possible part of the screen, and sometimes you get a "hit".
* This "hit" often comes as a new item, or a path to another state.
* As the game progres, it becomes harder to get a hit by clicking screen. However, your knowledge about unsearched part also should have deepened. Therefore, the stress level won't exceed.
* This "clicking stress and sometimes a hit" combination is nothing but one form of ["Stress and Catharsis"](#) pattern.

##How to make a unique Escape Game
* If it's about ["Stress and Catharsis"](#) pattern, the issue lies on player's level of experience.
* Some thinks it's too easy, while other think it's too hard.
* To tell a player's level of experience on this game, good guess might be "how many fail clicks are made by a player".
* If a player clicks nosense area so many times, You could put more hint items onto the screen.
* That way, everybody who tries the game thinks "it's an appropriate difficuly for me".
