#"Life Healing" Game Design

##Summary
* For example in "Candy Crush Saga", __there's a life that goes down__ by one when you lost the level.
* The point is that  __it recovers with certain time intervals__. ![Time Healing Life](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s23/sh/6aeeb178-e96e-4b45-9304-9071ebf4ffbd/b04667cb571c01496afdede3fbf4c3a4/deep/0/Candy-Crush-Saga-screenshot-2.png-(1024-768).png)
* __Life is also often purchasable:__ that is to say even if the time doesn't allow recover lives, __you can buy a life__ for certain amount of money.
* It became widely common since __smart-phone application games__.
* Because the in-app purchase transaction is easier than ever, people set up this system to monetize their games.

##Why people buy when it recovers naturally?
* Reason why it works is when you lose many lives, you're in this __narror-minded mode__.
* You rush to beat the level so much that __you don't really think carefully__ "is it worth it?".

##Advice to game developers
* Though it's an easy monetize point, __don't make it too harsh__ (e.g. limiting the number of lives one can posses too little, or in what time span life recovers).
* Also, __follow the industry-standard price for one life__. (I think for now, it's about __a dollar for one life__, with discount options on bulk purchase)
