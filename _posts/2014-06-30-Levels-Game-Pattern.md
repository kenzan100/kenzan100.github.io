#"Levels" Game Design Pattern

##Summary
* If you've heard of a term __"Level Design"__, this is much simpler than what they say.
* Level essentially is an act of converting a [Variable]({% post_url 2014-06-26-Variables-Game-Pattern %}) into higher dimention equation.
* Let's say there's a variable called "game experience points", which you earn every time you beat enemies.
* If that's the only points you can collect during the game, __what it produces is a really "severe" competition__.
* When you align all the players by how much they've earned game experience points, you soon realize that there are people who's earned too high for you to beat, since they devote so much time into game playing.
* That __limits the motivation of competition__, or motivation to grow as a player.

###Benefit of Level System
* Here comes in a level system, which will "convert" the points into __fewer goals__ a player can pursue: __levels__.
* Level sets this rule where the higher level a player reaches, the more points you need to level up 1 more step.
* This will essentialy __soften__ the competition, with __less steep curve__. ![Level System Curve](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s23/sh/cc82e2df-52a8-427f-8ed7-fff9aa475295/769ea25fdcb782287ac5d479d00a6f91/deep/0/LevelSystemCurve.jpg)
* Implication is that this will __make the game live longer__, as players are __evaluated less harsh__ each other.

##More Implications from actual games
* Think about __a Dragon Warrior or a Final Fantasy which only gives you experience points__, not converting to levels. ![Dragon Warrior without level system](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s23/sh/5e3f61ef-d8d5-4862-9c58-f44a505b22ca/6eddddcbfc622ee889c3458ce1647697/deep/0/Dragon_quest_battle_2.png-(256-224).png)
* First of all, it would be really hard to see how strong you become when game progress.
* And since character's strength directly relates to the experience points, when you play longer, you character becomes __too powerful to design game balance__(e.g. enemies parameter).
* Because there's a level which __gives you clear view how strong you character becomes__, you can be aware/pround of your progress in the game. If often results more word-of-mouth spread among their friends.

##And now into modern games
* In recent games(especially online), it's common that you can __"buy" levels under the name of "items"__.
* Reason why I consider those items as "levels" is that __any conversion that will end up with less variables are influenced by the logic above__.
* And lastly, advice from me: __Always set the converting ratio higher than previous level__. That's the golden rule of level up system.
