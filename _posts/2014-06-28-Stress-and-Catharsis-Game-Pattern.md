#"Stress and Catharsis" Game Pattern

##Brief Explanation
* This is one of the most powerful game design pattern I've seen, and also simple to understand.
* Every game should have certain kind of __"stress"__ coming ahead, and when a player overcomes that stress, a player should feed some kind of __"Relief"__.
* When there's a set of "stress and relief ahead", we start wanting more of them.
* As a result, __game becomes addictive__, as long as they can provide a combination of "stress and catharsis"

###Catharsis Definition
* In Wikipedia, an explanation of Catharsis is __"any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration"__.

##Applying to a game
* It's almost impossible NOT to find this pattern in a game.
* Any game comes with its set of rules, a player inevitably suffer from some sort of stress. It can just be as simple as learning new game rules, stronger enemies, or more complicated game elements.
* If we can provide a Catharsis in return, a player then can have motivation to keep playing the game.
* Just a simple example of Tetris, a classic game. ![tetris](http://gustoflight.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/tetris1.jpg)
* When aligning tetris blocks, you have hard time sorting them out. That's the inevitable stress part of the game.
* Then, suddenly you have this bar that can destroy so many lines at once. Here, __your emotion is changed completely__ into a joy.

##New Game Idea using this pattern
* Since it's a broad concept, I don't talke about one new game, but more __general advise__ how to turn a game into a great game.
  * Pick one game, and list all the stress point you can think of as a player.
  * And also list how they can overcome these stress, and what kind of emotion they'll release.
  * Think whether it's too much stress in advance, and also make sure these reward by overcoming stress is well given.

###Tetris Example
* The tetris example above, I've seen an advanced tetris game that adds more complicated blocks that's harder to use.
* Stress increases by this feature, but I don't think it adds any extra Catharsis to the game.
* If tetris's Catharsis is all about earsing many lines at once, __I would add a "dot" block__ that can penetrate exsiting blocks.
* So even if you missed to fill lines, later on, there's a chance to "fill" theses lines by inserting a "dot" block. ![add a dot block](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20967079/360px-Tetrominoes_IJLO_STZ_Worlds_svg.png)
* That should contribute to the game Catharsis more directly.
