#Post Frequencey to this blog
* I have to say posting everyday about the game design pattern was a bit harder than I first expected.
* From now, I will post new ones when I feel it's ready.
* Especially, I'd like to __focus making actual games with iOS platform__.
* Just till then, I'll tweet userful insights about game dev on my [Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/makegameswithme).
* Stay with me, and stay with making great games!
