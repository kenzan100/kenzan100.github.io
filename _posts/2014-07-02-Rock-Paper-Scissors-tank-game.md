#Game without variables

##This is a post presenting new game concept
* Today, I want to talk about a game with a new concept.
* As I've posted in [Level Game Pattern]({% post_url 2014-06-30-Levels-Game-Pattern %}), games with level ups have certain benefits.
* Also, talked in [Variables Pattern]({% post_url 2014-06-26-Variables-Game-Pattern %}), variable is one of fundamental elements of games.

##Downside of variables
* But there's also a downside of these variables.
* With variables, players become very __aware of their differences__ each other.
* Especially when you're a beginner in that game, if first thing you see is a scoreboard with many experienced players, what do you feel?
* __One would feel very discouraged__, feeling "No matter how much I've put my time in this game, it's impossible to beat them or compete with them".

##What about a game __without experience points__?
* To __avoid this inevitable isolation of players__, here's an idea: a game players compete each other without any increasing variables.
* To make it a real game, I narrowed game type to __"tank game"__.
* Tank game is like this: ![screenshot of a tank game](http://soft29.com/images/games/Tank-o-Box-2-b.jpg)
* Players control their tanks and shoot each other in 2d maps. __When you hit another tank__, you beat him. And __you earn certain points__.
* A tank game generally have multiple weapons/tanks to select from.
* And whey they have stronger weapons/tanks, it's easier to beat others. Also, __experienced players know how to control their tanks far better__ than beginners.

##Tommorrow's post is a detailed explanation of an actual "Tank Rock-Paper-Scissors game".
* Stay tuned!
