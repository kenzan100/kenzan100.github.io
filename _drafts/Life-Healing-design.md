##
* For example in Candy Crush Saga, Life you loose recovers within certain time intervals.
* Life is also purchasable.

* It became wisely common since the game apps in smart-phones.
* Because the in-app purchase made easy, people set up this system to monetize their games.

* reason why it works is when you lose many lives, you're in this narror-minded mode.
* You rush beating that level so much that you don't really think carefully "is it worth it?".

* Don't give it too much harshness how many lives one can posses, and in what ratio life can recover.
* Also, follow the standard money per life. (I think for now, it's about a $ for one life, with discounts on bulk purchase)
